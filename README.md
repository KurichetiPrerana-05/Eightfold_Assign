## Project Overview

Eightfold ingests candidate data from heterogeneous sources and produces a single, clean **CanonicalProfile**. The pipeline follows a strict flow:

```
detect → extract → normalize → merge → project → validate → output
```

Key features:
- **Five source adapters**: Recruiter CSV, ATS JSON, GitHub API, PDF Resume, Recruiter Notes
- **Identity-verification safeguard on GitHub enrichment**: bio/location/languages from a GitHub profile are only trusted into canonical fields if the profile's display name loosely matches a name already known from a higher-priority source (CSV/ATS); otherwise they're kept under `*_unverified` keys so a wrong/test username can't pollute a candidate record
- **Conflict resolution**: each field has a defined winner-picks rule (union, longest-wins, max, priority-order)
- **Provenance tracking**: every field records which source won and which extraction method was used
- **Confidence scoring**: overall and per-skill confidence scores (0–1)
- **Schema validation**: output is validated against a JSON-schema before saving
- **Custom projection**: a `runtime_config.json` can remap, rename, and filter output fields
- **Optional web UI**: `server.py` exposes the pipeline over a small FastAPI HTTP API, with `frontui.html` as a ready-made browser front end (file uploads, GitHub input, per-field provenance view)

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.9 or higher |
| pip | latest recommended |

---

## Installation

### Step 1 — Clone or unzip the project

```bash
# If cloning from a repo:
git clone <repository-url> eightfold
cd eightfold

# Or after unzipping:
cd eightfold/eightfold
```

### Step 2 — Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Step 3 — Activate the virtual environment

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Step 4 — Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` includes:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pytest>=8.0.0` | Test runner |
| `jsonschema>=4.20.0` | Output schema validation |
| `pdfplumber>=0.11.0` | PDF text extraction |
| `python-docx>=1.1.0` | DOCX support (optional sources) |
| `requests>=2.31.0` | GitHub API HTTP calls |

> **Note:** GitHub calls actually use Python's built-in `urllib`, so `requests` is not a hard runtime dependency of `github_source.py` — it's listed for convenience/compatibility with other tooling.

If you also want the optional web UI (`server.py` + `frontui.html`), install the extra packages it needs (not in `requirements.txt` by default):

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
```

### Step 5 — (Optional) Install the package in editable mode

This is recommended so that absolute imports work correctly when running tests or the CLI from any directory:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> **Note:** If there is no `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`, you can run the CLI directly from inside the `eightfold/` package directory, where the modules live.

---

## Generating Sample Data

The project ships with 3 PDF resumes in `data_inputs/`. Run the generator script to create the `sample_recruiter.csv` and `sample_ats.json` files needed by the CLI:

```bash
# Run from the directory containing generate_samples.py
python generate_samples.py
```

This will:
1. Read `data_inputs/candidate_1_resume.pdf`, `candidate_2_resume.pdf`, `candidate_3_resume.pdf`
2. Parse name, email, phone, GitHub, location, skills, experience, and education from each
3. Write `sample_recruiter.csv` — a structured recruiter export (one row per candidate)
4. Write `sample_ats.json` — an ATS-style JSON blob (one object per candidate)

Expected output:
```
[+] Wrote sample_recruiter.csv (3 rows)
[+] Wrote sample_ats.json (3 candidates)
```

---

## Running the CLI

The main entry point is `run.py`. All commands below assume you are inside the `eightfold/` directory (where `run.py` lives) with the virtual environment activated.

### Basic usage — minimal required arguments

```bash
python run.py --candidate-id <ID>
```

`--candidate-id` is the only required argument. It filters multi-candidate files (CSV, ATS JSON) to the matching row.

### Example 1 — Default sources (CSV + ATS JSON)

```bash
python run.py \
  --candidate-id ATS-0001 \
  --csv sample_recruiter.csv \
  --json sample_ats.json
```

### Example 2 — Add a PDF resume

```bash
python run.py \
  --candidate-id ATS-0001 \
  --csv sample_recruiter.csv \
  --json sample_ats.json \
  --resume data_inputs/candidate_1_resume.pdf
```

### Example 3 — Add GitHub profile enrichment

```bash
python run.py \
  --candidate-id ATS-0001 \
  --csv sample_recruiter.csv \
  --json sample_ats.json \
  --github octocat
```

### Example 4 — Add recruiter notes

```bash
python run.py \
  --candidate-id ATS-0001 \
  --csv sample_recruiter.csv \
  --json sample_ats.json \
  --notes path/to/notes.txt
```

### Example 6 — Save output to a JSON file

```bash
python run.py \
  --candidate-id ATS-0001 \
  --csv sample_recruiter.csv \
  --json sample_ats.json \
  --output output_profile.json
```

### Example 7 — Apply a custom output projection

```bash
python run.py \
  --candidate-id ATS-0001 \
  --csv sample_recruiter.csv \
  --json sample_ats.json \
  --config runtime_config.json \
  --output projected_output.json
```

### All CLI arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--candidate-id` | ✅ Yes | — | Unique ID to match rows in CSV/JSON |
| `--csv` | No | `sample_recruiter.csv` | Path to recruiter CSV file |
| `--json` | No | `sample_ats.json` | Path to ATS JSON file |
| `--resume` | No | `sample_resume.pdf` | Path to PDF/DOCX resume |
| `--github` | No | — | GitHub username or profile URL for live API enrichment |
| `--notes` | No | — | Path to a recruiter free-text notes `.txt` file |
| `--config` | No | — | Path to `runtime_config.json` for custom projection |
| `--output` | No | — | Path to write output JSON (prints to stdout if omitted) |

---

## Running the Web UI

`server.py` (in the project root, one level above `eightfold/`) exposes the pipeline over HTTP and serves `frontui.html` as a browser-based front end — useful if you'd rather drag-and-drop files and type a GitHub URL into a form than use the CLI.

### Install the extra dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
```

### Start the server

```bash
# From the project root (the directory containing server.py)
python server.py
```

This starts the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and serves the UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Open that URL in a browser.

### What the UI lets you do

- Upload a recruiter CSV, ATS JSON, and/or resume (PDF/DOCX)
- Type a GitHub username/URL
- Upload a recruiter notes `.txt` file
- Click one of the three bundled sample candidates to pre-fill from `sample_recruiter.csv` / `sample_ats.json` / `data_inputs/`
- See the merged profile, per-field provenance (which source won each field), warnings, and any failed sources

### API endpoints (if you want to call it programmatically instead)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/run` | `POST` (multipart/form-data) | Run the pipeline against uploaded files / typed GitHub value |
| `/api/sample/{candidate_id}` | `GET` | Run the pipeline against the bundled sample data for `ATS-0001` / `ATS-0002` / `ATS-0003`, optionally layering `?github=...` on top |
| `/` | `GET` | Serves `frontui.html` |

`/api/run` accepts these form fields, all optional except `candidate_id`: `csv`, `json`, `resume`, `github` (text), `notes`, `config`.

---

## Using the Python API

You can also drive the pipeline programmatically using `pipeline.py`:

```python
from eightfold.pipeline import run

sources_config = {
    "recruiter_csv": {"path": "sample_recruiter.csv"},
    "ats_json":      {"path": "sample_ats.json"},
    "resume":        {"path": "data_inputs/candidate_1_resume.pdf"},
    "github":        {"username": "octocat"},
}

result = run(sources_config, candidate_id="ATS-0001")

print(result.profile.full_name)       # CanonicalProfile object
print(result.output)                   # dict — projected, JSON-serializable
print(result.errors)                   # list[str] — schema validation errors
print(result.warnings)                 # list[str] — soft issues (failed sources)
print(result.failed_sources)           # list[str] — sources that returned ok=False
```

### With custom projection config

```python
import json
from eightfold.pipeline import run

with open("runtime_config.json") as f:
    output_config = json.load(f)

result = run(sources_config, output_config=output_config, candidate_id="ATS-0001")
print(result.output)
```

---

## Configuration — Custom Output Projection

`runtime_config.json` controls the shape of the output. Example:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    { "path": "full_name",     "type": "string",   "required": true },
    { "path": "primary_email", "from": "emails[0]","type": "string",   "required": true },
    { "path": "phone",         "from": "phones[0]","type": "string",   "normalize": "E164" },
    { "path": "skills",        "from": "skills[].name", "type": "string[]", "normalize": "canonical" }
  ],
  "include_confidence": true,
  "on_missing": "null"
}
```

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `fields[].path` | Output field name |
| `fields[].from` | Source path in the canonical profile (supports `[]` for list traversal) |
| `fields[].required` | If `true`, missing value is flagged as a validation error |
| `fields[].normalize` | Optional normalization hint (`E164`, `canonical`) |
| `include_confidence` | Append `overall_confidence` to output |
| `on_missing` | What to emit for null fields: `"null"` or `"omit"` |

---

## Supported Data Sources

### 1. Recruiter CSV (`recruiter_csv`)
Standard spreadsheet export from a recruiter's ATS or CRM. Expected columns include `name`, `email`, `phone`, `current_company`, `title`, etc.

### 2. ATS JSON (`ats_json`)
Vendor-neutral JSON blob. The adapter tries multiple dotted key-paths per canonical field, supporting Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, and custom schemas.

### 3. GitHub (`github`)
Calls the GitHub public API (`https://api.github.com/users/<username>`) to fetch name, bio, location, public repos, and programming languages. No authentication token required for public profiles; rate-limited to 60 requests/hour unauthenticated per IP.

Includes an **identity-verification safeguard**: a GitHub username/URL is just operator-supplied text, with no guarantee it actually belongs to the candidate (wrong handle, placeholder like `octocat`, a same-named stranger). If a `known_name` (from a higher-priority source like CSV/ATS) is passed in and it doesn't loosely match the GitHub profile's own display name, the bio/location/languages are written to `*_unverified` fields instead of the canonical ones — so they never silently fill gaps with an unrelated person's data. The profile URL itself is always kept under `github_url`, since linking to whatever was typed in is harmless even if it turns out to be the wrong account.

### 4. PDF / DOCX Resume (`resume`)
Uses `pdfplumber` (PDF) or `python-docx` (DOCX) to extract raw text, then applies regex/heuristic patterns for email, phone, name, and a skills section if one exists. Every read/parse step is wrapped so a corrupted or scanned (image-only) file degrades to `ok=False` rather than crashing the pipeline.

### 5. Recruiter Notes (`recruiter_notes`)
Free-text file (`.txt`) containing a recruiter's notes about the candidate. Years of experience, skill mentions, and summary text are extracted.

---

## Merge & Conflict Resolution Policy

When the same field is present in multiple sources, the following rules apply:

| Field | Policy |
|---|---|
| `full_name` | Prefer longer name; structured sources take priority |
| `emails` | Union across all sources, deduplicated |
| `phones` | Union across all sources, E.164-normalised, deduplicated |
| `location` | First non-null wins; structured sources have priority |
| `links` | Union (GitHub, portfolio filled from different sources) |
| `headline` | Prefer longest value; GitHub bio > ATS summary > notes |
| `years_experience` | Max of explicit declaration, derived from experience spans |
| `skills` | Union; `confidence` = fraction of sources that mention the skill |
| `experience` | Prefer ATS/CSV; deduplicated by `(company, title)` pair |
| `education` | Prefer ATS/CSV; deduplicated by `(institution, degree)` pair |

**Source priority** (highest to lowest) for single-winner fields:

```
recruiter_csv > ats_json > resume > github > recruiter_notes
```

---

## Output Schema

The default output is a JSON object validated against this schema:

```json
{
  "candidate_id": "ATS-0001",
  "full_name": "Jane Doe",
  "emails": ["jane@example.com"],
  "phones": ["+919999911111"],
  "location": {
    "city": "Coimbatore",
    "region": null,
    "country": "IN"
  },
  "links": {
    "github": "https://github.com/janedoe",
    "portfolio": null,
    "other": []
  },
  "headline": "Full Stack Developer with 4 years of experience...",
  "years_experience": 4.0,
  "skills": [
    { "name": "python", "confidence": 1.0, "sources": ["recruiter_csv", "ats_json", "resume"] }
  ],
  "experience": [
    { "company": "Acme Corp", "title": "Backend Engineer", "start": "2022-01", "end": "present", "summary": null }
  ],
  "education": [
    { "institution": "MIT", "degree": "BTech", "field": "Computer Science", "end_year": 2022 }
  ],
  "provenance": [
    { "field": "full_name", "source": "recruiter_csv", "method": "exact_match" }
  ],
  "overall_confidence": 0.85
}
```

### What `overall_confidence` actually measures

`overall_confidence` is a **completeness/coverage score, not an agreement score**. It does not check whether sources agree with each other on a field's value — it only checks whether key sections of the profile ended up populated, and how many sources contributed overall. It is computed as:

```
field_score  = (number of key sections populated) / 9
source_score = min(number of contributing sources / 3, 1.0)   # saturates at 3 sources
overall_confidence = round(field_score * 0.7 + source_score * 0.3, 2)
```

The 9 key sections checked are: `full_name`, `emails`, `phones`, `headline`, `skills`, `experience`, `education`, `location`, `links`.

So a score of `1.0` means every one of those 9 sections has *some* value and at least 3 sources contributed — it does **not** mean every source agreed on every field. A candidate run with only CSV + ATS (no resume/GitHub) will score lower simply for having fewer contributing sources, even if those two sources fully agree on everything. Per-skill confidence (in `skills[].confidence`) is a separate, narrower metric — that one *does* measure cross-source agreement, as the fraction of sources that mention a given skill.

## Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'eightfold'`

The package is not on the Python path. Install it in editable mode from the project root:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or run scripts from inside the `eightfold/` directory where the modules live.

---

### `[-] No records found for candidate-id '...'`

The `--candidate-id` value does not match any row in your CSV or JSON. Check the `applicant_id` or `candidate_id` values in your files:

```bash
python -c "import json; data=json.load(open('sample_ats.json')); [print(d.get('applicant_id')) for d in data]"
```

---

### GitHub API rate limit hit (`HTTP 403`/`429` in the `github` source warning)

The GitHub adapter uses the unauthenticated public API, limited to 60 requests/hour per IP — and that IP is often shared (CI runners, sandboxes, office networks), so you can hit the limit faster than expected. There is currently no authenticated/token mode in `github_source.py`. If you hit the limit, wait an hour, or test from a different network. This is a soft failure — the rest of the pipeline still runs, the GitHub source just contributes nothing (check `result.warnings` / `failed_sources`).

---

### Web UI / `server.py` won't start (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`)

The web UI's dependencies aren't in `requirements.txt` (they're optional). Install them separately:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
```

---

### `pdfplumber` fails to extract text from a resume

Some PDFs are image-only scans. `pdfplumber` can only extract text from text-layer PDFs. Use an OCR tool (e.g., `pytesseract` + `pdf2image`) to pre-process scanned PDFs before passing them to the pipeline.

---

### `[!] Warning: Strict canonical structural validation notice: ...`

This is a soft warning — the pipeline still completes. The output field mentioned does not match the expected JSON-schema type. Check your `runtime_config.json` field mapping or the raw source data for that candidate.
